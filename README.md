# MindCanvas

MindCanvas is a web-based visual note-taking application that lets you think, connect, and organize your ideas spatially. Designed as an interactive canvas, it enables users to create various types of notes (text, images, json-like structures) and connect them visually using links â€” much like building a mind map or a concept board.

> âš¡ Built with React, TypeScript, and powered by [xyflow](https://reactflow.dev/), this tool is ideal for brainstorming, visual documentation, and personal knowledge management.
